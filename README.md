# SM2715-Interactive-Image-Transition

This image transition effect was inspired by the low pixel portrait from the second assignment, which reminded me of CRT TVs with lower quality.

As display technology is advanced nowadays, it is always uncomfortable and unpleasant to watch some relatively low-resolution videos. Thus, my artistic and creative dicision for this image transition assignment is to change the original picture into a low-quality picture like itâ€™s on the CRT monitor, and then the picture is broken pixels by pixels, and finally, another high-resolution picture is displayed.
